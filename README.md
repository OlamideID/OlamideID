ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Idowu Akinola Reuben!

ðŸš€ Mobile Application Developer | Flutter & Dart Enthusiast | Cybersecurity & Digital Forensics Graduate Student

I specialize in mobile application development using Flutter and Dart, following Model-View-Controller (MVC) and Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectures to create scalable, maintainable, and high-performance applications.

Currently, Iâ€™m pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics at Bingham University, where Iâ€™m deepening my knowledge of securing digital systems and investigating cyber threats.

Beyond coding, Iâ€™m passionate about football (a huge Cristiano Ronaldo and Manchester United fan! âš½). Iâ€™m always looking to collaborate on exciting projects and explore new innovations in tech.
